# TestBot

Sample code for creating a whatsapp bot using twilio. The messages recieved on the bot's number 
is POSTed on a webhook url by Twilio. I have created a sample project on NodeJS which recieves
the message and then responds to it.

## Getting Started

Clone the git repo to get started.

## Prerequisites

Node.js >= **v16.13**

## Run

In order to run the script, run

```
node index.js
```

The server will start listening on port 8080
Now configure your url on Twilio and see the magic!

## Extra tip

Use ngrok for exposing your localhost server on the internet ;)
